title: Announcing ROCA
---

A week has passed since Stefan [announced](http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2012/03/announcing-roca/) [ROCA](http://roca-style.org/). 
ROCA stands for _Resource oriented Client Architecture_ and aims at providing helpful rules - or, if you want - a set of
guidelines on how to build decent Web application frontends. That is also the "official" claim.
You may criticize that using the word _decent_ implies a subjective rating.

I think that ROCA strongly obstructs some of today's opinions of building Web applications,
especially those of the single page JavaScript app advocates. There are cases where things like client-side MVC
might make sense, but lumply degrading web servers to plain JSON API pipes not undertaking the job of what they 
were built for - rendering HTML - is clearly the wrong way.

So far the [reactions](http://roca-style.org/discussion.html) [are](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3672436) mostly positive. We also merged in lots of feedback and are eager to get to know yours!
